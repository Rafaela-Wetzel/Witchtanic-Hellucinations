I have tested the responsiveness of my homepage with Firefox, Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge Dev Tools and checked the following screen sizes: 360px (Galaxy S5 Android 5 on DevTools and my own mobile phone Moto G50), 576px, 768px, 992px and 1200px (DevTools and my own laptop Lenovo ThinkPad X260). I confirm that the actions below work on all screen sizes.
