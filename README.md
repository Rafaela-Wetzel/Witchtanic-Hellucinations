# Live Demo

# UX

## User Stories

The target group is people who...
- look for spooky amusement
- like to play online games
- are fans of horror, supernatural figures & all things dark

## Strategy

- Design a spooky witch memory card game whose outcome is influenced by the users' effort
- For entertainment purposes
- Tells a story

## Scope

- Game page & contact / feedback page
- Start button & memory card game
- Spooky sounds & cursor
- Rules and instructions page? / Help button?

Maybe at a later point:
- Levels of difficulty

Take into account:
- Accessibility / Keyboard-focussable

Interactivity / JavaScript
- Card unveils when clicking on it (event listener)
- Two cards are compared with each other
  - If match, they stay uncovered
    - Match count increases
    - If user wins the game
      - "Happy" end ?
  - If no match, they are covered again
    - Timer: only x seconds to play, if user fails:
      - Unhappy end
- Individual alert messages (or modal box windows) depending on winning or losing
- Timer that runs out
- Card match count
- Button to end game in between
- Shuffling cards function

## Structure 

- Make sure it is easy to understand what the game is about when starting to play
- Story & memory card game to the right
- Nagivation bar, picture, sound, timer, card match count to the left

## Skeleton

- Balsamiq wireframe
- Position the elements to the left according to priority
- Contrast in colors between left side (info) and right side (play)
- Contrast in colors within info section to the left

### Wireframe 

<img src="assets/readme-assets/Balsamiq Witchtanic Wireframe.png" style="height:40rem; width:40rem;" alt="Balsamiq Wireframe">

## Surface

- Spooky fonts
- Colors: black & neon green? Pumpkin orange?
- Gnarly witch picture (contact artists)
- Background picture? 
- Effects: story alerts depending on outcome of game
- What can user do? Click start button, play card game, play audio, visit contact section, see GitHub repo

# Testing 

I have tested the responsiveness of my homepage with Firefox, Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge Dev Tools and checked the following screen sizes: 360px (Galaxy S5 Android 5 on DevTools and my own mobile phone Moto G50), 576px, 768px, 992px and 1200px (DevTools and my own laptop Lenovo ThinkPad X260). I confirm that the actions below work on all screen sizes.
